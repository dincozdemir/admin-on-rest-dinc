## How We'll Work

### Icon Design Workflow

We'll be releasing design concepts for icons as we make progress. Please check the project's [milestones](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome-Pro/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open) for icon design status. Icons will be organized in the following ways:

* Icons will be kept within the [`icons`](ttps://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome-Pro/blob/master/icons) directory in the repo.
* Font Awesome Free icons will be organized in the [`icons/free`](ttps://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome-Pro/blob/master/icons) directory
* Font Awesome Pro icons will be organized in the [`icons/pro`](ttps://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome-Pro/blob/master/icons/free) directory
* Icon category packs will be contained within the `_categories` folder of `free`/`pro` directories.
* Each icon will have a production-ready version (`[icon-name].svg`) created for each of its styles and states.
* We may eventually add preview boards of different icon groups (styles, categories, etc.) for easier browsing/consistency reviews.
* We may share more work in progress files for specific icons as part of pull requests.

We'll use the following tools to design and produce icons:

* Adobe Illustrator
* Inkscribe
* SVGO for optimization

### SVG Framework

Work for the new SVG Framework will be taking place inside the `svg-framework` directory. Go there now, [it's got its own README](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome-Pro/tree/master/svg-framework).
