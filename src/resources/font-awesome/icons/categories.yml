    Apparently, Adblock Plus can remove Font Awesome brand icons with their "Remove Social Media Buttons" setting. We will not use hacks to force them to display. Please [report an issue](https://adblockplus.org/en/bugs) with Adblock Plus if you believe this to be an error. To work around this, you'll need to modify the social icon class names.
